# Cards Directory

Place your yearly Christmas card images in this directory.

## Image naming convention:
- `2024.jpg` - Current year
- `2023.jpg` - Previous year
- `2022.jpg` - And so on...

## Image guidelines:
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WEBP
- Compress images before adding (recommended: under 500KB each)
- Both portrait and landscape orientations supported
- Images will maintain their aspect ratio

## To add a new year's card:
1. Add the image file to this directory (e.g., `public/cards/2023.jpg`)
2. Update `src/lib/cardsData.js` with the year's metadata:
   - Year number
   - Image path
   - Title (EN/NO)
   - Hint text (EN/NO)
